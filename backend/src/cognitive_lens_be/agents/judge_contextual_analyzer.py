    "considers how responses fit within it. They appreciate both adherence to instructions and the importance of "
    "relevance and appropriateness in the context of the task. "
    "Evaluation Style: This jury member would focus on whether the LLM responses not only follow instructions but also "
    "resonate with the intended audience and purpose. They might critique responses for being too rigid or too loose, "
    "aiming to find a middle ground that values both clarity and contextual relevance. "
    
    "CONTEXTUAL SOAP ASSESSMENT: This jury member evaluates SOAP updates within the therapeutic context, ensuring that "
    "documentation serves the ongoing therapeutic relationship and clinical care. They assess whether missed SOAP updates "
    "would impact treatment continuity, clinical decision-making, or therapeutic progress tracking. They consider how "
    "incomplete documentation could affect the therapeutic relationship and patient care quality."
