General Appearance: Alert, oriented, appears uncomfortable but in no acute distress. HEENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic, pupils equal and reactive, no JVD.

  A: "45-year-old male with acute onset chest pain, most consistent with musculoskeletal chest pain given pleuritic nature and absence of cardiac risk factors in presentation. Differential diagnosis includes costochondritis, intercostal muscle strain, or atypical presentation of cardiac disease. Low suspicion for pulmonary embolism given absence of risk factors and normal oxygen saturation. EKG shows normal sinus rhythm with no acute ST changes. Chest X-ray pending. Given patient's history of hypertension and diabetes, will rule out cardiac etiology with serial cardiac enzymes and monitoring.",
  P: "1. Chest pain workup: Order EKG (completed - normal), chest X-ray, and cardiac enzymes (troponin I). 2. Pain management: Ibuprofen 600mg orally now and then 400mg every 6 hours as needed for pain. 3. Monitor vital signs every 4 hours. 4. NPO until cardiac enzymes result. 5. If cardiac enzymes negative and chest X-ray normal, discharge home with follow-up instructions. 6. Return precautions: Return immediately if chest pain worsens, develops radiation to arms or jaw, experiences shortness of breath, or any concerning symptoms. 7. Follow-up with primary care physician within 1-2 days. 8. Continue home medications as prescribed."
