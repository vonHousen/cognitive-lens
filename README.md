# Cognitive Lens: Multi-Agent AI Quality Assurance System

Project created for the [AI Engineer World's Fair Agents Hackathon (2025)](https://cerebralvalley.ai/e/aiewf-hackathon-2025).

Cognitive Lens implements an AI jury system where specialized judge personas (Detail-Oriented, Contextual Analyzer, Creative Thinker) evaluate agent responses under a central Judge-Orchestrator using majority rule principles. The flagship implementation features an AI Therapist that conducts therapeutic sessions while maintaining real-time SOAP (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan) clinical documentation, with the jury ensuring both therapeutic quality and healthcare compliance standards are met.

## Final results: demo video used for project submission
Terribly sorry for the quality, we had no enough time to make a better video.
